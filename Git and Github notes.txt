initially you have to login to your github in your local system
by adding the user name and user mailid in the cmd

commands ->git config --global user.name ""
	 ->git config --global user.email ""

if you want to copy the the folder in the github to your local
system use
	 ->git clone __________
		origin link
after cloning
	 ->cd _____ the cloned file name

after changing the files in your local system
	 ->git status 
		it show the currnt status
	 ->git add ___________ mention the file name in the space
	 ->git commit -m "commit message"
	 ->git push origin main

from this the changes made in the local system is updated in the 
git repository

if any changes happened in the git repository it will be visible
in the local system by adding commmand
	 ->git pull

new working folder is created in the local system. Adding the new
folder in the github as new repository
first change the current directory to new folder
	 ->cd ..
now  go to the new folder
	 ->cd ______  put the folder name
	 ->git init
	 ->git add . if we put dot here all the changes made will
be added
	 ->git commit -m "message"
	 ->git push origin main will show error as no orgin

so we have to create a new repository in the github and then 
in terminal type as
	 ->git remote add origin the new repository link

now the branch name or new repository will be master. if  we try
to push by using ->git push orgin main it will again show error
	 ->so now we have two option one is we use the master as
 branch name like ->git push origin master  or we can change the
banch name by using ->git branch -M main


now we  can see about branches
	 ->git branch -a 
		this command shows all the branches in this
 repository
For creating a new branch
	 ->git branch branchname

To switch branch
	 ->git checkout ________   branchname

if we make changes in the new branch and push. the changes will 
be happend only in the current branch. The main branch will not
be modified

Checking the difference between the branches use command
	 ->git diff branchname from another branch

to add the modification in the mainbranch from the new branch
	 ->git merge newbranch
	 ->git push origin main
